            </div>Reflecting on 2021 Don&rsquo;t you also still think that last year was 2019? ðŸ˜£ 2021felt like such a repeat of 2020 that it didn&rsquo;t feel like a different year! For instance, we have still not recovered from the economic effects of the pandemic and are starting to feel its effects mentally and emotionally. International travel is still largely not possible and thus my wife and I are equally homesick as we&rsquo;ve not been back home in almost 5 years and it doesn&rsquo;t look like it is going to change!]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Having changed roles (or at least titles) almost once every year (TAM@2014âž”SAM@2016âž”TSM@2017âž”TAM Lead@2018âž”CSM@2019âž”CSA@2020), I don&rsquo;t usually make a huge deal about role changes but this is a major pivot ending a 7 year long chapter in my career and thus an exception.
Bitter sweet moment as this minute will mark the end of a 7 year long chapter in my career.

    <description><![CDATA[Reflecting on 2020 Now no matter where you are located geographically or how old you are, I&rsquo;m going to take a wild guess and assume that we can agree how brutal 2020 was. Personally looking back, the year 2020 has been crazy, challenging and definitely packed a punch.. A year with mixed fortunes, 2020 was a year that I&rsquo;ve never imagined in my lifetime.
Timeline Here is a look at how I experienced 2020&hellip;]]></description>
