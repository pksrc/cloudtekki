            </div>I&rsquo;m in my 3rd month of my Product Management career and as I get comfortable with the role, I&rsquo;ve realized that in this role I feel like I&rsquo;m thriving, adding value and making the most impact! These days, I am excited to get out of bed and I have trouble sleeping because I&rsquo;m already excited about what I can accomplish the next day!
As I look back at my Journey to be a well rounded Product Manager, I realize that it started when I was a 2 years into my fresh out of college developer role.]]></description>

            </div>Recently I had the opportunity to lead a Project where I had to define a scalable process (repeatable by nature) that streamlines a customer's product adoption experience for a particular use case.

It is equivalent to adopting a new IDP solution as you&rsquo;ll have to re-federate all the apps in order to successfully complete a migration.
And this is case regardless of where you are trying to move from -
On-Premise to SaaS  As Cloud is picking up steam and as features are developed with a cloud-first mentality, tt makes sense to offload the management of the Access Service to VMware This scenario is also getting more common as Access and Hub Services are FedRAMP certified as of CY Q4 2020  SaaS to SaaS  This is a not very common use case but few situations demand them nonetheless predominantly due to issues arising from high customization entertained early in the product adoption lifecycle Another use case for is populating a UAT or a DEV tenant with Apps from another tenant   Path to Migration First and foremost, a migration is possible as documented in @williamsmt blog which provides a detailed walk through of the entire migration approach.]]></description>
