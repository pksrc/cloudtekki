[{"categories":["TWO CENTS"],"content":"I‚Äôm in my 3rd month of my Product Management career and as I get comfortable with the role, I‚Äôve realized that in this role I feel like I‚Äôm thriving, adding value and making the most impact! These days, I am excited to get out of bed and I have trouble sleeping because I‚Äôm already excited about what I can accomplish the next day! As I look back at my Journey to be a well rounded Product Manager, I realize that it started when I was a 2 years into my fresh out of college developer role. I enjoyed coding and it felt like I was creating music or art! While I wasn‚Äôt the best developer, I enjoyed solving problems through code and could get lost doing it for hours. However by the 2nd year, I had started yearning for more and wanted to understand more about the Business problems that I was solving (the cx) and if there were better ways to address their problems. To transition, I did my Masters in Information System with the goal of becoming a Business Analyst of some kind (a role that I think is comparable in parts to Product Management). I thought I‚Äôll get to do this through the ‚ÄúConsultant‚Äù experience that I was going to get at AirWatch (later acquired by VMware). This decision gave me the pleasure of working closely with Customers, understanding what their perspectives on a certain topic and also a front row seat to observing their processes. A great experience overall‚Ä¶ NOTE: The only caveat to taking this approach of seeking out different experiences in one‚Äôs career is that I had very minimal control over how long those experiences would be. I was a developer for one year too many. I planned to be in the field for 4 years and it took me 7 years instead. The reasons for these varied ranges from personal issues to lack of motivation to political issues. For this blog post, I wanted to summarize my most valuable learnings over the seven years of working closely with Customers in the hopes that it will help folks with their Customer relationship management!

The way I‚Äôve understood Trust through the many years of working closely with Customers as their trusted advisor and something I‚Äôve practiced can be expressed as $$Trust = (Honesty + Empathy) * Consistency$$ Simply put, to earn trust in any capacity (Professional and Personal) you have to be honest and empathetic. The more consistent you are, the more Trust you tend to build. Everything Wrong\" Everything Wrong As I reflect back on my experiences, here are some additional thoughts A Trusted Advisor provides an unbiased and honest viewpoint about any given situation and ensure everyone involved has clarity.. PRO TIP: use data to build credibility as needed A Trusted Advisor aims to balance Company direction and Customer needs. When a Customer needs something, they evaluate the ask and after completing the necessary due diligence on all possible options, they ensure they are taking all the steps to help obtain the needed results. As a Trusted Advisor, you always evaluate every possible options with the Customer which ensures transparency and builds credibility. In addition to my thoughts above, I wanted to also summarize Trust as defined by the The Trust Equation $$Trust = \\frac{Credibility + Reliability + Empathy}{Self Orientation}$$ Credibility has to do with the words we speak. In a sentence we might say, ‚ÄúI can trust what she says about intellectual property; she‚Äôs very credible on the subject.‚Äù Reliability has to do with actions. We might say, ‚ÄúIf he says he‚Äôll deliver the product tomorrow, I trust him, because he‚Äôs dependable.‚Äù Intimacy refers to the safety or security that we feel when entrusting someone with something. We might say, ‚ÄúI can trust her with that information; she‚Äôs never violated my confidentiality before, and she would never embarrass me.‚Äù Self-orientation refers to the person‚Äôs focus. In particular, whether the person‚Äôs focus is primarily on him or herself, or on the other person. We might say, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt trust him on this deal ‚Äî I don‚Äôt think he cares enough about me, he‚Äôs focused on what he gets out of it.‚Äù Or more commonly, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt trust him ‚Äî I think he‚Äôs too concerned about how he‚Äôs appearing, so he‚Äôs not really paying attention.‚Äù With these thoughts, I hope I‚Äôve given you some insight into building, earning and retaining Trust with your Customers.

Since I‚Äôd always been building things, I started to channel that energy towards enabling the TAM team by building SME teams, Labs, Automated tools and processes that help the team scale and be more efficient with their Customer Engagements. Jun 2017 RELOCATION For the welfare of the family, I had to set my career plans aside and relocated from Atlanta to Seattle.

This blog post is targeted at Workspace ONE UEM administrators who are being asked to prevent unmanaged devices from accessing Office 365 applications. Typically some of the biggest concerns center around, but aren‚Äôt necessarily limited to: Access to the Outlook for iOS or Android application. Access to applications like Teams or OneDrive. To be fair, the solution I am proposing is one of several methods. In fact, VMware and Microsoft have collaborated on an effort to allow Workspace ONE UEM device compliance status to be used to evaluate conditional access policies on Azure application. This is done by essentially daisy chaining the trust and device ID from the Authenticator app on a mobile device and using Workspace ONE Intelligence to communicate that status to Azure. It works fantastic, especially if you are already leveraging Authenticator as your MFA provider. However, it‚Äôs not perfect and can be difficult to get rolled out. I‚Äôve provided some documentation below, in case you want to read up on the details.

Namely: Requiring your users to install the Microsoft Authenticator App. This can be challenging if your user already has the app installed, or if they‚Äôve installed it outside of an Android Work Profile, for instance, where your managed apps will be deployed. Requiring your users to manually register their device in Azure AD, beyond just installing the app and signing in for MFA challenges. Requiring your users to tap on a web link you push to their device via the Hub Catalog or App Catalog, or try to sign in to a Conditional Access protected app and failing, which provides instructions on how to trigger VMware Intelligent Hub to ‚Äútrust‚Äù the Microsoft Authenticator app. It‚Äôs fraught with peril due to human error and requires your end-users to do something before they can be granted access. Sometimes the device can take a while to populate in Azure‚Äôs devices portal, which can cause false denials. We push compliance status in real time to Azure, but it can take a bit to reflect. The conditional access policies in Azure are tied to some pretty broad categories, so you can require conditional access to all Office 365 apps, but couldn‚Äôt explicitly allow unmanaged access to something like Microsoft Word, for instance. It‚Äôs a bit of an all-or-nothing approach. You can get somewhat granular by selecting ‚ÄúExchange Online‚Äù to prevent access just to Outlook app, but that also affects things like Teams.

If yes, get the UUID for the group and add to entitlements for that app. If no, we skip this group entitlement for the app Upon completion, a Message Box shows the status of the migration how many succeeded, how many failed (for unknown reasons), how many apps were skipped because they were not found in the destination tenant and how many apps assignments were skipped because the groups didn‚Äôt exist in the destination tenant I‚Äôm hoping you‚Äôll take advantage of the WS1 Access Migration Tool to save yourself some time.

When adopting a product or a solution to any use case, a Customer would typically work with multiple teams. The journey starts from a Customer evaluating a new product and all the way to installing and managing the product. The Objective was to define a process that makes this a standardized approach for a certain use case so all customers have a very streamlined experience. To achieve this, this conceptual process that needed to be wholistic and formulate a behavior change of an entire Organization. During the early stages the project, I had a general idea on what we wanted to achieve but there were no clear directions. I started by interviewing and brainstorming with several team members. After several working sessions, we started to get a sense for what what we needed to produce as a comprehensive process. Once I had the process charted out, I met with several leaders to get their buy-in. Thanks to the team‚Äôs work, we got amazing feedback with every meeting and commitment from all the leaders to support the initiative. Throughout this experience, I had the amazing opportunity to work with a several stakeholders ranging from accomplished individual contributors to senior leaders from various teams. While I had no authority over the team that I worked with, we were able to work together on this common objective and produced amazing results. While no one had to agree to our Vision for defining a Customer‚Äôs adoption journey, every leader wanted to help and pitch in.

Do the necessary leg-work to ensure that the idea is sound, that it really solves the problem that it intends to solve and that there is a sufficient appetite for the Solution (i.e., ensure the Problem is worth solving). Once you are convinced, you'll want to get buy in from both the Sponsor(s) and the Team. Depending on the circumstances around how the idea originated and your confidence level on the idea, you can either take a top down approach or bottom-up approach Top-Down - When your confidence level on the hypothesis is high, make an executive pitch covering the problem, your hypothesis and the value it can bring to the organization. Getting buy-in from an executive sponsor is going to help when you start to engage with the team and help make the team‚Äôs buy-in easier to accomplish. Bottom-Up - When your confidence level on the hypothesis is low, you should run the idea by the team (or) your peers (or) industry experts to get their feedback. If they throw up any red flags, you should plan on addressing that first and further refining your hypothesis. On the other hand if they get excited about the hypothesis as you are, you are already winning here! Use the team‚Äôs buy-in as ammunition in your pitch to get commitment from the executive sponsor. Let‚Äôs further break down the buy-in phase by looking into these following areas- Start with the Why As Simon Sinek states in the video below, you have to understand and clearly communicate the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind your hypothesis and if they are inspired, you‚Äôll have a team that will be self motivated to make the idea a reality. Ask yourself the following Why are you building the product or service? What is its purpose? Why should it exist? What is the team‚Äôs belief? What is your Organization‚Äôs belief? If the team is newly formed or don‚Äôt already have a working relationship, you might have to run through this exercise multiple times to ensure there is consensus. With a high-performance team or with teams that have already formed a bond, the best way to influence is by showing them the direction and getting out of their way as most driven individuals prefer to have a detailed understanding of the goal and then have the freedom to come up with various options to achieve that goal. Drive Consensus During the early stages of the Project and any time there is a shift in direction, it is important that you drive consensus amongst the team members on the Vision, the Design/Plan, the Experience that you intend to drive. The last thing you want is a dysfunctional team working on a solution without clearly understanding the problem or the goal that needs to be accomplished. Being hyper clear about and writing down your understanding of the Scope and Goals of the project is going to help significantly. Set the expectation so your team stick to those guidelines and that they should be prepared to adapt to any changes as new information surfaces. Early on when the team is ‚Äúforming‚Äù is a great time to encourage healthy debates and explore various ideas and thought streams. This also allows you to get your team to practice getting into a state of consensus - everyone agrees to commit to a certain stance (after debating through an idea). Reason to Logic Data never lies‚Ä¶ When you have access to the data to solidify a theory, always aim to let the data tell the story. Data can help validate your hypothesis and will help get buy-in from any stakeholder easily. While intuition is critical, data can help fact-check your intuition and thus can be very valuable. When I had to convince our sponsor and the team on the need to focus on defining the Customer Journey for a particular use case over other, I used previously do","date":"2021-03-21","objectID":"/post/art-of-influence/:3:1","tags":["People"],"title":"The Art of Influence and Persuasion","uri":"/post/art-of-influence/"},{"categories":["TWO CENTS"],"content":"Part II: Collaboration There are going to be times when you don't have a lot of data to back up your hypothesis but your instinct (primed from working on the subject longer than others) knows that there is a certain direction to take but you are not able to produce a just argument explaining why the team should side with your approach. With enough social capital and built trust, you are going to be able to ask for favors from your team. As you start getting acquainted with the team, your goal is to encourage collaboration and start building a sense of trust with the team. This will help build the social capital that you're going to tap into as you go through the Project. Let‚Äôs look further at various tips around Collaboration that I leveraged when I started working closely with the team- Build Relationship I learned about this concept of thinking about our relationships with colleagues as a bank account. Similar to dealing with a bank account, the balance in your Account represents how strong your relationship is. When you have a high balance, withdrawing money is easy and straight forward. Similarly, when you have a strong relationship where you have already built a strong foundation of trust and sense of comradery, you can easily ask for favors. PS: Beware of asking for too many favors or asking a huge favor that might strain the relationship. This is similar to attempting to withdraw more money than you hold. Sure your bank can loan you some amount but when you go beyond your credit limits, they might break ties with you. Similarly when you return the favor or thank someone for their help or when you do a favor to someone, you are depositing money into your Relationship account. The more you deposit, the more your bond strengthens thus increasing your ability to seek help. For more than one reason, it is good to build one on one relationship with your team members as you‚Äôll never know whose help you‚Äôll need to get an idea pushed through. There have been several instances where I‚Äôve had to tap on my relationship with one individual and have that person broker an introduction or get a team/individual that they are more familiar with on the Solution. People are more likely to hear from someone they already know vs someone that they have just started working with. Speak the language Understand your audience and know your team members so you can speak their language (not literally but based on what you share in common) Are they your peers? Are they external or internal? Are they senior or junior to you? Are they technical or business focussed? There is no better way to influence the direction of a Project than finding the common thread that you share together and building on top of that. As an examples if you are working with developers, you‚Äôll want to know some common terms or go further to learn some aspects of the technology. This is going to help build trust with the team as well. Seed the Idea Once an idea... ‚ÄúOnce An Idea Has Taken Hold Of The Brain, It‚Äôs Almost Impossible To Eradicate‚Äù - Dom Cobb, Inception One trick that I‚Äôve heard about (but not been very good at executing) is the ability to seed an Idea within your team or another individual. This requires a lot of tact and patience to be position a thought within your team. If a team is able to persuade themselves on the plan or a certain direction there is nothing that can beat that. This also helps build team work and nurtures a self-organizing team - which is often the goal of Agile methodologies being leveraged in most organizations. Listen, Ask Questions ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to know all the answers‚Äù - a very useful advice that someone gave me leads me to the next topic. Your goal to encourage team collaboration is to let the team talk more during meetings and for you to take a role where you are facilitating conversations and not directing these meetings.

There is always a bright idea and a vision for a better future. What sets apart a winning idea from others is the ability to execute on the idea. It takes a significant amount of will and drive to push through all the barriers, unblock all the road blocks and punch through all the uncertainties that you are going to encounter. I've spent countless hours preparing and thinking about what approach I should take to convince someone on a certain direction - how should I present the idea, what sort of language and tone should I use, how should I deal with push backs etc. During the Execution phase, it is important to manage conflict and have a good lay of the land to negotiate or renegotiate terms effectively- Managing conflict This could be an entire post on its own. As you work together as a team, conflicts are going to arise. Not everyone is going to see eye to eye and thus you want to foster this culture of being able to disagree but committing to a certain direction. Be sure to document the decision and agree to live with the consequence as a team. When unhealthy conflicts do arise, my biggest advice (having dealt with a lot of conflicts) is to nip it out in the bud - easier said than done, right? It is actually pretty easy if you are observant of your team‚Äôs dynamics. In my experience, when you get two folks (that have conflict) have a sidebar and once you have them voice out both their perspectives, they start seeing reason and don‚Äôt tend to be very combative. An alternate approach is to let the team sort it out themselves and only step in if it gets to a point where someone‚Äôs behavior start impacting team‚Äôs productivity. Negotiate As you work towards your idea, there are going to be challenges such as scope creep, changes in timelines or budget or even shift in focus. It is important to be able to negotiate with your team, with your stakeholders as well as your sponsors. For your sanity, Negotiation tactics are going to help balance expectations across the various Stakeholders that you are going to work with. Imagine a situation where you find yourself in a position where your timeline to deliver a project has reduced. Your team has already committed to a time and it might be too difficult to ask them to work overtime to deliver this feature. You should attempt to work with your stakeholders to buy more time as well as explore possible options with your team. Gathering the details on constraints and the reasoning on either side will help arrive at a reasonable middle ground for this situation. Another example that comes to mind is also timeline based - assume you need to deliver a new grandiose feature and when you approach your team, they say it‚Äôs going to take half a year which is not going to fly with the Customer. In this situation, the ideal compromise is to see if you can break up the feature into smaller chunks that can be delivered over time to the point where it is agreeable to the Customer. This is also great as the Customer can also see the progress to the commitment over time. Boss vs Leader\" Boss vs Leader Lead by Example While you are not managing the team you are working with, you are responsible for their Success and the success of your Initiative. Your team is looking up to you for guidance and you have to be the one that needs to make tradeoff decisions and living with those decisions. You have to go the extra distance and show commitment to the cause. For if you are not committed, your team will never be and the result will be as mediocre as your commitment. In these roles and especially with high performing teams, it is also crucial to lead and nudge the team forward by leading from the front.

Either sides‚Äô needs while well-intentioned may seem to be at conflict with each other.. Business aims to innovate and promote new capabilities for their consumers with the goal of improving services delivered or user experience to retain existing users or acquire new users. IT as true partners to the Business want to provide the right platform and infrastructure but need to ensure that they guaranteeing the right security guidance, conformance to standards and best practices. A key area that often exacerbates this divide is how interaction between Business and IT teams are facilitated. Traditionally and in a majority of existing Enterprises, Ticketing Systems are often the preferred way for Business to engage IT. Once a request is placed, it is then subjected to an elaborate Change Management Approval process before initiating a project requested by Business. Such processes ensure thoroughness but stunts innovation agility. Modern Cloud Platforms have challenged that approach by enabling anyone with just a credit card to spin up Servers, Services or Desktops anytime ‚Äî leading to the rise of Shadow IT. What if we bring these cloud-like capabilities to the SDDC? F. Gold and I recently delivered a VMworld Session where we built a demo of doing just that! Arm Yourself with Event-Driven Functions and Reimagine SDDC Capabilities [HCP1404] ‚Äî http://bit.ly/pksession The idea stemmed from my work with the VMware Event Broker Appliance (VEBA). VMware Event Broker Appliance deployed with OpenFaaS provides the ability to deploy functions which can be triggered in two different ways ‚Äî Event Driven ‚Äî example function that get triggered on an event to make a POST request to an HTTP endpoint is available here (works with Pagerduty, Slack, ServiceNow, ServiceDesk, Jira etc) Command/User Driven ‚Äî enabled through the function‚Äôs HTTP endpoint as explained in OpenFaaS‚Äôs blog here As Team #VEBA continues to look for ways to stretch the boundaries around capabilities unlocked through VEBA, I wanted to partner up with F.

As we started putting our heads together and thinking of a good usecase to explore both the event-driven and command/user driven capabilities, the idea of a Slack bot came to mind along with some auto-remediation of issues. Here are the questions that we sought out to answer For the Command/User driven use case, What if IT enables Business Stakeholders to interact with VMware SDDC through a Slack command to ‚Äî Create a VM ‚Äî This can be useful in the early stages of enabling self-service. IT can control the size of the VM spec by possibly starting with their standard VM Spec or maybe even a lower Spec Clone a VM ‚Äî This can enable horizontal scaling of their Application or troubleshoot configuration issues by cloning their existing VMs Clone from a VM Template ‚Äî When Business teams standardize on a VM Spec and Template, IT could create a VM Template as specified by Business and validated by security. This template can be cloned by the user for their Application deployment Power cycle VMs ‚Äî At any given time, there may be a need to power cycle VMs (outside of the OS controls available). These controls can be provided to the user and also giving them the power to utilize resources efficiently Delete VM ‚ÄîIT can offload resposible clean up of SDDC resources by enabling the BU to delete VMs on demand For the event-driven use case, what if certain crises are handled automatically thus increasing operational efficiency ‚Äî Vertical Scaling a VM ‚Äî Not everyone has a clear understanding of what their VM‚Äôs spec is going to be. More often than not, to play safe, the request for VM Spec has added buffer and is unreasonably sized. What if when a VM is running low on CPU or Memory resources, a function is triggered to auto increase the VM Spec (by 1 CPU upto a predetermined max value and by 2Gb upto a predetermined max value). This will enable Business teams to start with a low or appropriately sized VM and give the assurance that VMs can scale up to handle any future loads Auto Storage DRS ‚Äî When a host datastore is running out of space, a function can be triggered to move the VM to a different datastore. {{}} ","date":"2020-10-07","objectID":"/post/self-service-for-your-datacenter/:1:0","tags":["event-driven","cloud-native"],"title":"Enabling Self Service for your DataCenter ‚Äî Part I","uri":"/post/self-service-for-your-datacenter/"},{"categories":["VEBA"],"content":"Architecture To make this App a reality, we are going to build three main components First, the Gateway function called **iaasgw** written in **python**‚Äî This function is going to recieve the Slack bot command and based on the command, triage to a set of VM Lifecycle functions.

To get started, you‚Äôll need the certbot cli installed. On a mac, i was able to install the certbot using homebrew. brew install certbot Once certbot is succesfully installed, you can generate the certificate using the command below. sudo certbot certonly --manual -d path.domain.com --preferred-challenges dns After providing the affirmation to a couple of questions, certbot will request you to update the DNS to create a TXT record with _acme-challenge.path.domain.com with a generated value from certbot.

One function with roughly 200 lines of code and VMware Event Broker Appliance (VEBA)! Would you believe it if I said that setting up these systems took me longer than getting them to work with VEBA? Before I dive into the function itself, let‚Äôs understand the components for making a REST API call. Typically, you‚Äôll need ‚Äî metaconfig-servicenow.json\" metaconfig-servicenow.json URL: http(s)://system.example.com/v1/rest/object METHOD: usually POST but could be PUT, PATCH or DELETE etc HEADERS: API specific but usually in some sort of key value pair AUTHN: Username and Password or None in some cases BODY: API specific but takes some sort of data in json (or xml) This function aims to take these information needed to make a REST API call as configurational values and provides a way for you to pull information from the events, automatically map them to the body through mappings as shown below before firing the API request. In this very simple ServiceNow example (screenshot), the value for short_description within the body will automatically be replaced with the value of the FullFormattedMessage within the data object that we get from the vCenter Event. To integrate with more systems, all that you need is to build out this metaconfig for the different systems by providing the Rest API information and the mapping to update the request body with the event information. The function takes care of validating the event, updating the request body with the event information and making a POST request to the API. NOTE: Currently this function makes a single POST call to REST APIs to that support basic authentication, token within headers type of authentication or no authentication That‚Äôs how effortless this function along with VMware Event Broker Appliance (VEBA) makes modern integration possible with your SDDC with minimal or at times no coding.

WARN if debug is enabled\" WARN if debug is enabled Logger utility class\" Logger utility class This allows us to write stderr debug messages while stdout gets sent back to OpenFaaS as the output. The function WARN users that debug is enabled and sensitive information could be logged into the console. With this in place, a logger function was added to produce colorized output in the console for readability and enhanced debuggability. test.py provided for local testing\" test.py provided for local testing The util.py is now imported into the handler.py and abstracted away for the function developer who can now focus only on building the core business logic for their usecase! I‚Äôve also moved all the test cases to outside of the package and located within the test.py and it‚Äôs been improved to run multiple test cases in one go. Make sure to edit this file to update with test cases that are relevant to what you are looking to accomplish. These changes certainly helped me write, test and debug my functions faster. While OpenFaaS has an easy process to build, deploy and invoke your function with an OpenFaaS gateway in place, the idea behind these changes and providing a local test script is to speed up the development/testing process by a few hours.

This is a significant capability that exposes a plethora of integrations and allows seamless automation opportunities for a VMware SDDC customer. As the Product Manager, I wanted to take the opportunity to write a function not only to contribute and help the team but also as an effective way to understand one of our persona that we are targeting ‚Äî developers and especially the ones that are new to programming. This exercise of building a function gave me several insights as well as enabled me to learn more about our product and the underlying tech capabilities and constraints.
