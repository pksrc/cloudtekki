I've just crossed the 90 day mark on my recent Product Management stint with the Employee Experience team with Workspace ONE. As I get comfortable with the role, I've come to realize that in this role I feel like I'm thriving, adding value and making the most impact! These days, I am excited to get out of bed and I have trouble sleeping because I'm already excited about what I can accomplish the next day!

As I look back at my Journey to become a great and well rounded Product Manager, I realize that it began almost 10 years ago when I was a 2 years into my fresh out of college developer role. While I remember having fun while I was coding and remembering that it felt like I was creating music or art, I didn't believe I could be the best developer there could be. What I did enjoy the most in that period was my ability and inclination to solve problems through code and in doing so I could get lost doing it for hours. 

By the 2nd year, I had started yearning for more and wanted to understand more about the Business impacts and outcomes we were producing and felt like I had the right skillset to identify the right problems to solve. A step in the direction was completing my Masters in Information System with the goal of becoming a Business Analyst of some kind (a role that I think is comparable in parts to Product Management). I believed I'll get the exposure about identifying the right problems by working closely with Customers through the "Consultant" role at AirWatch (later acquired by VMware). This decision gave me the pleasure of working closely with Customers, understanding what their perspectives on a certain topic and also a front row seat to observing their challenges and what problems were top of mind for them to address. It was a great experience overall... 

> The only caveat to taking this approach of seeking out different experiences in one's career is that I limited control over how long those experiences would be. I was a developer for one year too many. I had planned to be in the field for 3-4 years and it took me 7 years instead. The reasons for these varied ranges from personal issues to lack of motivation to political issues. 

Having spent close to a decade working with Customers and as I embark on the next chapter of my life, I wanted to write this blog post to summarize my most valuable learnings from working closely with Customers in the hopes that it will help others with their Customer Relationship Management!
