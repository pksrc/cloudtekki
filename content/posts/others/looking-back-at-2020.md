# Reflecting on 2020

Now no matter where you are located geographically or how old you are, I'm going to take a wild guess and assume that we can agree how brutal `2020` was. Personally looking back, the year `2020` has been crazy, challenging and definitely packed a punch.. A year with mixed fortunes, `2020` was a year that I've never imagined in my lifetime. 

## Timeline

Here is a look at how I experienced `2020`...

Work:: Kicked off the year by taking a huge risk - being very passionate about an incubation Product [#VEBA](https://vmweventbroker.io) (a [Fling](https://flings.vmware.com/)), I attempted to try my hand at Product Management and building on top of my [2019 UW certification](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pky_ending-a-very-mixed-2019-on-a-positive-note-activity-6617927565573263360-DPGI)
Life:: We had the most snow since moving to the Pacific NorthWest in 2018 :snowman:

Work:: The Product Management stint got uncertain real quick (thanks to COVID-19) as early adopters hunkered down to support their new and growing remote workforce
Life:: Along with the rest of the world, we were coming to terms with COVID-19 and this was also the last month that my wife and I worked out of an office in `2020` :office:

{{% timeline timelinedate="2020-03-10" %}}
Work:: I got to learn more about [Team #VEBA](https://vmweventbroker.io/#team-veba)! As Customer interactions were limited during this time, I turned my focus towards building a strong marketing foundation for the Product - [built a website](https://vmweventbroker.io) and [delivered a Brown Bag session](https://youtu.be/tOjp5_qn-Fg). Additionally, I took inspiration from my awesome team to build [my own home lab](https://pkblah.medium.com/why-a-homelab-9f604752c623)
Life:: My wife and I were adjusting to the new remote work life, challenged as we were putting in more hours working from home along with managing our almost one year old :baby:

Work:: Marked the official end of my TAKE 3 Product Management experience only to get me more skilled at and exposing me to Product Development, Open Source, Marketing techniques including writing blogs and delivering talks. Needless to say, I continue to work with [Team #VEBA](https://vmweventbroker.io/#team-veba) in my free time

Work:: The month of complete uncertainty as I pondered about the path ahead for my career :confounded:

## A lot to be thankful for

`2020` also gave us a lot of things to be grateful for...

- Lucky for the time we got to spend with our daughter - would have otherwise been a lot of time commuting, at work and very little time with her
- Enjoyed not having to commute everyday - 2 hours of backed up Washington traffic everyday
- Thankful for the Take3 Program at VMware where I learnt a variety of new skills - blogging, website design (again), video editing, building slick presentations, delivering the right message to the right audience
- Met with, drew inspirations and learned a lot from these awesome folks 
  - **William Lam** {{% twitter profile="lamw" %}} - Someone who looks to unlock potential in both technology and in people. He has years of documented knowledge, passionate about technology and always learning
  - **Michael Gasch** {{% twitter profile="embano1" %}} - Go expert and the most thoughtful and detail oriented person I've ever met
  - **Robert Guske** {{% twitter profile="vmw_rguske" %}} - The most friendliest TAM and someone who has guided me on my homelab and my blogging journey :pray:
  - **Patrick Kremer** {{% twitter profile="kremerpatrick" %}} - The most avid learner who taught me that there is always more to be discovered and learnt
  - **Frankie Gold** {{% twitter profile="codegold79" %}} - The most helpful person ever and also noticed that front-end work brings out her dark side :stuck_out_tongue:
  - **Vladi Velikov** {{% twitter profile="vladi_velikov" %}} - Leave it to him to go from ideation to prototype in the shortest time possible
- Invested the time and money to build my homelab which helped me understand buying decisions, design considerations and all that comes with managing a private cloud
- Experienced 3 different roles in the span of a 6 months - Managing large Customers to Managing an upcoming Product to being a Technologist 
- Grabbed the opportunity to start working with a well rounded team of Architects and made a bunch of new friends
- Met with more friends (over video calls) than would have normally been possible 
- We made better acquaintances with our neighbors - they are the most helpful and the best neighbors one can ask for! 
- Taught me to prioritize and focus on the right goals - a number of things that I promised myself that I'd do and failed - being a kubernetes contributor, running every day of 2020, building 10 whiteboards for technology concepts, adding NSX to my homelab, automating my homelab for EUC use cases

Reflecting back, this year threw a curve ball at a lot of us. We are thankful to be safe, healthy, being together and minimally impacted by 2020. My heart goes out to all the first responders and those that were adversely impacted by COVID-19, the fires and all things that were 2020. 

## Challenge yourself! 

This year came at me with a lot of challenges and uncertainties not only at work but at home as well. With the support of my family, I took this as an opportunity to learn new skills and build new things. This year gave me an opportunity to push myself, kept me on my toes and enabled me to step outside of my comfort zone where I thrive! 

As you read this, hopefully you are inspired and motivated to get out of your comfort zone, to try something new, to embrace and meet any challenges head on, to keep pushing yourself to achieve your goals and dreams! :fist:
