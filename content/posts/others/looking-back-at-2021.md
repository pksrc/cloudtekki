# Reflecting on 2021

Do you also think that last year was `2019` and we are still in an extended `2020`? :persevere: `2021`felt like such a repeat of `2020` that it didn't feel like a different year! For instance, we have still not recovered from the economic effects of the pandemic and are starting to feel its effects mentally and emotionally. International travel is still largely not possible and thus my wife and I are equally homesick as we've not been back home in almost 5 years and it doesn't look like it is going to change! While we didn't catch **C:mask:VID**, our family did get hit with other medical ailments (thanks to our 2 year old and the other effects of the pandemic) and it made `2021` another challenging year! 

> It is telling how 2021 felt like an extension to 2020 because much like last year, Netflix made a [Death to 2021](https://www.avclub.com/netflix-is-ready-to-say-death-to-2021-in-a-new-comedy-s-1848264525) movie :grimacing:


## My Learnings

However, it has not been an entirely gloom and doom kind of year! I've been able to make a career pivot to join a new role and team. I now manage a Product that enables Employees around the globe to securely access their work apps, search for their peers, get notifications from their organization and also self manage their devices. I wake up every morning excited about the possibilities and I'm proud to build and grow a phenomenal Product that caters to more than 2 million Monthly Active Users!

`2021` was challenging but it also had a lot of positives! Here is the count of events as how I've navigated `2021`...

## 2021 Timeline

Work:: I started January finishing up my pet projects which was [redesigning CLOUD TEKKIÂ®](https://twitter.com/pkblah/status/1353486423127539717?s=20) and working to complete my very first [Fling](https://flings.vmware.com/) that'd help Customers migrate Applications between any two WS1 Access tenants. 

Life:: I started a 3 month diet and a get back in shape program and the beginning is always the hardest part!

Work:: I built an automation script using [Packer](https://packer.io) that automates a [Windows 10 build and enrolls the machine to Workspace ONE](https://twitter.com/pkblah/status/1364213423739838468). Another automation build which helped me get a foundational understanding of Kubernetes as well as do something new for the K8s community was automating the provisioning of a [multi-node Kubernetes cluster ](https://twitter.com/pkblah/status/1361839286509727746) using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)! Simultaneously, I was also [writing my blog](https://twitter.com/pkblah/status/1358132508987039747?s=20) on enabling Kubernetes management natively on vSphere. 

Life:: I didn't have a life as it was pretty much workout, hack, eat, sleep and repeat. I did however learn how to [correctly say on premises](https://twitter.com/pkblah/status/1365365268822695940?s=20) :grin:

Work:: I worked on writing a blog about my learnings from a major cross-functional Project that I had worked on last year which aimed to help Customers seamlessly adopt our Products. A key element to its success were the soft skills that I had to [quickly learn and demonstrate](https://twitter.com/pkblah/status/1377244292616482816?s=20). I also had the opportunity to participate in my first [Hackathon event](https://twitter.com/pkblah/status/1384737059621937153?s=20) to further build ESO

## Summary of my 2021

This year began as a grind, we endured various medical ailments and it ended with a lot of surprises (as the grind continues)! All that aside `2021` also gave me a lot of things to be grateful for...

- I've rediscovered my passion for writing code which enables me to create and explore new things :blush: 
- It has been 3+ years from when I had decided to take the reins on my career and decided to be a Product Manager. Several hardships later, I'm grateful to the team that gave me the opportunity to redefine my career and I am now a strong Senior Product Manager with a well-rounded IT experience
- I've also helped motivate others take the next step in their careers and enjoyed seeing others take their career to the next level! 
- CLOUD TEKKIÂ® gets close to 300 views every week in just one year of operation! 
- CLOUD TEKKIÂ® also serves as a platform for many first-time bloggers. I invested a lot of time encouraging and motivating many to document their learnings and expertise on a given subject ([here](https://twitter.com/pkblah/status/1413622881779519490?s=20) and [here](https://twitter.com/pkblah/status/1415007052166955008?s=20))
- We suffered a lot medically and yet I count ourselves lucky as we have gone through the year without any major lifestyle impact!
- Thanks to remote work and the technology that enables it, we got to spend a lot of time watching our daughter grow! 
- I'm also picking up the guitar :guitar: back again after 8 years as music makes me connect to my spiritual self and learning music only seems to make me appreciate it more! 

## Goals for 2022
For the upcoming year, my focus is going to be on three key areas 
  - **Great at Product Management** (and have fun along the way)
  - **Focus on Impact** (on our Customers and on the Industry) **and Growth** (of my team, of my product and as a person) 
  - **Learn from the best** (through books or mentors) **and share my learnings along the way**

Other goals are to enable more folks to share their learnings through CLOUD TEKKIÂ® and to make progress on learning guitar. 

## What's your takeaway?

Why do I share my retrospective for a given year? **Purely to motivate, inspire and also to share my experience**! 

> Here is my retrospective of [2020](/post/looking-back-at-2020/)

I transparently share my learnings so you can see how I've navigated my way through an unpredictable + unprecedented year and also to give you a view into my mindset over the course of a year. I didn't know that I'd achieve my goal of being a Product Manager this year. However, I've been tirelessly working towards that goal for many years and I was able to make that dream a reality when the opportunity presented itself! 

Another reason why I share my experience is to remind folks how eventful any given year can be! A lot of us tend to get tunnel visioned or lose focus at times and the year seems to go by uneventfully. A lot of us skip setting goals or managing the path we take and soon find ourselves lost amidst the chaos. While it is hard to predict what the future holds, we can set a goal and continue to work towards it! Going through this exercise of retrospection and goal setting makes me (and hopefully it also makes you) realize how eventful any year can be and how you can manifest opportunities for yourself! Challenges are going to present itself and as you persevere, they are going to make you stronger and enable you to hit those personal goals for the year!

As you read this, hopefully you are inspired and motivated to get out of your comfort zone, to try something new, to embrace and meet any challenges head on, to keep pushing yourself to achieve your goals and dreams! :fist: Here's to an exciting and challenging 2022! If you are reading this, I'd love to know how you experienced 2021? What are your plans for the New Year?
