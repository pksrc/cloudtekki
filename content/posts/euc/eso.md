<p class="cap">
Unified Access Gateway (UAG) is a key component in most VMware End User Computing deployments, including Workspace ONE and Horizon. The UAG hosts various Edge Services like VMware Tunnel, Content Gateway, Secure Email Gateway, Reverse Proxy and Horizon Secure (External) Access. Additionally, the UAG can also provide DMZ Authentication and Identity Bridging. These services play a pivotal role in providing Zero Trust Network Access to corporate resources.
</p>

Now that we have established the significance of the UAGs, it is imperative that any organization would require metrics from monitoring the UAGs. While there are options to monitor the UAG from an appliance/infrastructure perspective, customers also require metrics at the Edge Service level (Eg: Authenticated VPN Tunnel Sessions etc.) to gain visibility into the connections being authorized into the company network to access resources. Currently, there is no centralized view of metrics consolidated from all UAGs across all Edge Services, nor is there a way to visualize trends over a period. __Project ESO – Edge Services Observability__ (released as [VMware Fling](https://flings.vmware.com/edge-services-observability "Project ESO")), is a monitoring solution that polls Edge Services metrics from all UAGs and renders the data as dashboards for visualization. Additionally, administrators have the ability to configure alerts based on conditions to get notified and detect anomalies.

## Features
ESO is delivered as a _ready-to-deploy_ virtual appliance, containing the following:
 1. Web based Admin Portal for configuring the list of the UAGs that need to be monitored
 2. Curated Dashboards with customizable widgets for visualizing metrics polled from UAGs for
	- VMware Tunnel
	- VMware Horizon
> **Bonus:** Also included is a dashboard to monitor performance of the ESO appliance itself
 3. Ability to setup alerts based on configurable triggers

 10. You are now viewing the “VMware Tunnel Dashboard”
	 {{<image src="/img/euc/eso/eso_9.png" caption="VMware Tunnel Dashboard">}}
> 	 **Dashboard** is a collection of widgets <br>
	 &bull;  Every widget is called a __Panel__ <br>
	 &bull;  A group of panels is called a __Row__
 11. The VMware Tunnel Dashboard is split into two rows
	 - UAG Appliance Performance Metrics
	   - UAG Appliance CPU, Memory performance metrics
	 - VMware Tunnel Metrics
	   - VMware Tunnel Session and Connection Metrics
 12. To view Horizon Dashboard, navigate to Dashboards menu on the left pane, and select "Manage"
 13. Now select "Horizon Dashboard"
	 {{<image src="/img/euc/eso/eso_27.png" caption="VMware Horizon Dashboard">}}
 14. The Horizon Dashboard is split into two rows
	 - UAG Appliance Performance Metrics
	   - UAG Appliance CPU, Memory performance metrics
	 - Horizon Protocol Sessions Metrics
	   - Horizon Protocol Sessions (PCOIP, Blast, RDP) Metrics
> **Note:** The sample dashboards provided contain panels (widgets) for visualizing curated metrics from VMware Tunnel and VMware Horizon Edge Services. However, as an administrator you have the option to configure any of the additionally available metrics as widgets for the existing dashboards, as well as build new dashboards for other Edge Services as needed. Please refer to the “Tips & Tricks” section for steps to configure additional metrics in Dashboard as a widget/panel.
 
## Tips & Tricks
### Admin Portal
1. How to obtain UAG Admin Portal's (served on port 9443) certificate thumbprint?
	- Install openssl on your Operating System and run
		- macOS/Linux
		``` openssl s_client -connect uag_hostname:9443 < /dev/null 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -fingerprint -noout -in /dev/stdin -sha256 ```

		- Windows <br>
		``` openssl s_client -connect uag_hostname:9443 | openssl x509 -fingerprint -noout -sha256 ```
		
	- Thumbprint Format
		- A thumbprint is in the format __alg=xx:xx__, where _alg_ can either be the SHA1, SHA256; _xx:xx_ are hexadecimal digits
		- Eg: SHA256=2C:C4:40:7A:5C:01:7A:66:AE:47:ED:FA:0B:F6:D9:86:AA:EA:25:AE:BD:9F:E4:3F:AC:AC:91:2F:E8:56:14:6
2. What do the "Polling states" listed on the "Manage UAGS" page indicate?
	- **INIT**: UAG has been added and waiting for the system to begin querying
	- **PAUSED**: The UAG was reachable but returned an unexpected http(not 200) response (retry will occur after 30 minutes after last state change)
	- **ERROR**: Error occurred when reaching the UAG (retry will occur after 30 minutes after last state change)
	- **CHECK**: A transient state that tells the system to validate the certificate of the UAG
	- **POLLING**: Successfully querying the UAG and data is being processed
3. What should you do when you see an "Error" under "Polling State"?
	{{<image src="/img/euc/eso/eso_34.png" caption="ESO Admin Portal - Error Polling State">}}
	- Check if the UAG is active - specifically the stats URL at https://uag-hostname:9443/rest/v1/monitor/stats
	- Ensure that you have provided the correct credentials (password expires every 90 days) and thumbprint for certificate presented by the UAG stats URL
	- Wait 30 minutes (from the last state change time). Once in Error state, the system will stop reaching out to the UAG for 30 minutes and only after 30 minutes from the last state change will another attempt be made again
	- If issue persists, check logs at /root/manager/log/exporter.log and file a bug at Project ESO Fling with relevant screenshots and logs
4. How do you reset password to login to ESO Admin Portal?
	- SSH into the ESO Virtual Appliance
	- Run the following command to reset password for ESO Admin Portal
		``` curl -i -X PATCH -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"admin","password":"enter new password here"}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/users ```

### Dashboards
1. How frequently is the ESO polling the UAGS for metrics?
	- ESO polls the configured list of UAGS every 1 minute for metrics
2. What is the data retention period in ESO for the metrics polled from UAGs?
	- Currently, metrics are stored for 30 days
3. How to configure additional metrics as widgets?
	- From the Dashboards page, click on "Add Panel"
	{{<image src="/img/euc/eso/eso_32.png" caption="Dashboards - Add Panel">}}
	- Navigate to the "Query" tab on the bottom of the page
	{{<image src="/img/euc/eso/eso_28.png" caption="Dashboards - Add Panel - New Metrics Query">}}
	- Click on the dropdown next to "Metrics"
	- All available metrics polled (as applicable) are listed in the dropdown
	- Select the desired metric from the list
	- Provide a title to the Panel, adjust the Visualization settings on the right pane as required
	- Click on 'Apply' on the top right section of the page
4. How to monitor the performance of ESO Appliance itself?
	- From the Dashboards menu, select "Manage" 
	- Select the "ESO Appliance Stats" dashboard
	{{<image src="/img/euc/eso/eso_21.png" caption="ESO Appliance Stats">}}
	- This dashboard contains widgets for monitoring performance metrics (CPU, Disk, Memory, System, Network) from the ESO Appliance
	{{<image src="/img/euc/eso/eso_26.png" caption="ESO Appliance Stats">}}

## What Next
We are evaluating integration options with various tools including serverless functions to orchestrate workflow actions based on ESO telemetry. There is certainly a lot more to come on that front, so stay tuned ...
